        "    \"The CACNA1A gene encodes the transmembrane pore-forming subunit of the P/Q-type or CaV2.1 voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) (Kordasiewicz et al., 2006). Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels not only mediate the entry of Ca(2+) ions into excitable cells but are also involved in a variety of Ca(2+)-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Diriong et al. (1995) noted that calcium channels are multisubunit complexes and that the channel activity is directed by a pore-forming alpha-1 subunit, which is often sufficient to generate voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel activity. There are at least 6 classes of alpha-1 subunits: alpha-1A, B, C, D, E, and S, which are derived from 6 genes representing members of a gene family. The auxiliary subunits beta (e.g., 114207), alpha-2/delta, and gamma (e.g., 114209) regulate channel activity. In addition to full-length CACNA1A, use of an internal ribosomal entry site in the CACNA1A transcript generates the CACNA1A C-terminal polypeptide, or alpha-1ACT, which functions as a transcription factor that mediates cerebellar development (Du et al., 2013).\",\n",

Two genes span the CTG/CAG repeat and are expressed in opposite directions: ATXN8 (613289), which encodes a nearly pure polyglutamine expansion protein in the CAG direction, and ATXN8OS, which, when transcribed, produces a noncoding CUG expansion RNA (Moseley et al., 2006).\",\n",

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase, has been implicated in a variety of regulatory processes, including cell growth and division, muscle contraction, and gene transcription. PP2A is composed of a 36-kD catalytic subunit (176915), a highly homologous 65-kD structural subunit (176915), and any of several different regulatory subunits that control its specificity, including PPP2R2B (Mayer et al., 1991).\",\n",

FGF14 belongs to a subclass of fibroblast growth factors that are expressed in the developing and adult central nervous system (Smallwood et al., 1996).

It is a DNA-dependent ATPase that binds in a structure-specific manner to the 3-prime end of a primer hybridized to a template DNA, an activity thought intrinsic to the 140-kD component of this multisubunit complex (Bunz et al., 1993).\",\n",
        "    \"By Southern blot analysis of a 900-kb critical region on chromosome 16q21-q22, followed by sequencing analysis, Sato et al. (2009) identified 2.5- to 3.8-kb insertions containing pentanucleotide repeats including a (TGGAA)n sequence in all 160 affected individuals from 98 families with SCA31 (117210). PCR amplification followed by sequencing showed that the insertion consisted of a preceding TCAC sequence, and 3 pentanucleotide repeat components (TGGAA)n, (TAGAA)n, and (TAAAA)n in all patients tested. In a homozygous patient from whom the 900-kb critical region was derived, the authors found a (TGGAA)n sequence of greater than 110 repeats and a (TAAAATAGAA)n sequence of greater 112 repeats, both of which were too long to be read through. The (TGGAA)n and (TAAAATAGAA)n sequences were separated by a bridging sequence and (TAGAA)46. The insertions were located in introns of the BEAN (612051) and TK2 (188250) genes, which are on opposite strands and transcribed in opposite directions. These insertions were not identified in 99.77% of 800 Japanese and 60 American chromosomes, or in individuals with SCA4 (600223). However, 2 (0.23%) of 860 control chromosomes did carry similar smaller 1.5- or 2.0-kb insertions without (TGGAA)n sequences. Sato et al. (2009) concluded that the insertions in SCA31 patients exerted their toxicity either because of their length or the (TGGAA)n sequence, or because of both. The length of the SCA31 insertion was inversely correlated with the age at disease onset. Further analysis showed that the insertion site was identical for all insertions and was located at an Alu sequence. A single-nucleotide change in an intron of the TK2 gene segregated with SCA31 but was not considered to be pathogenic. The repeat insertions did not appear to cause splicing abnormalities or alterations in the expression levels of BEAN, TK2, or other nearby genes. Sato et al. (2009) demonstrated that the insertion transcribed in the direction of BEAN formed RNA foci in approximately 30 to 50% of Purkinje cell nuclei from SCA31 patients but not in cells from controls. RNA foci were not observed for antisense probes corresponding to TK2 transcripts in SCA31 or control brains. The splicing factors SFRS1 (600812) and SFRS9 (601943) were found to directly bind to (UGGAA)n, the transcribed sequence of (TGGAA)n, in vitro. In silico analysis showed that (TGGAA)n was abundant in centromeres of several human chromosomes, suggesting a role in heterochromatin or chromosomal structure.\",\n",
